  content: "Po-Ju is interested in the community- and ecosystem-level consequences of species interactions, with a particular focus on how plant communities are structured by the interactions among plants and their associated soil microbes. As a community/theoretical ecologist, he enjoys collaborating with other lab members on the variety of projects that they developed. Po-Ju received his PhD from Stanford University, where he studied the temporal dynamics of plant-soil feedbacks and species coexistence theory with Tadashi Fukami. He was subsequently a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University with Jonathan Levine, studying the demographic context of plant-soil feedback, before joining National Taiwan University in 2021."
